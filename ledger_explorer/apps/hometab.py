# Ledger Explorer (ALPHA RELEASE)

Quickly navigate through flow and balance charts as line charts, drill down into account rollups, and get from annual totals to individual records in a register all on one page.  Import CSV from files or URLs, match the columns, handling tens of thousands of records quickly.  Chart any data that comprises individual transactions, each with a time, amount, and category/account.
