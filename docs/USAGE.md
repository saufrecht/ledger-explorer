### Features
This tab determines which data the program uses.  It reads Transaction CSV exports from GnuCash, and can read any csv file with these properties:
* one row is one ledger entry.  That is, either an full entry in single-entry bookkeeping or either the credit or the debit from double-entry.
* The following columns are present and labelled exactly:
  * **Account Name**.
  * **Description** and/or **Notes** *(optional)*.  Any blanks in these fields get filled with the closest previous entry.
  * **Memo** *(optional)*  Not filled.  Combined with 'Description' and 'Notes' to make a single 'description' field.
  * **Full Account Name**.  An ordered list of the account tree, delimited by colons.  For example: "Assets:Short-Term:North Korean Energy Bonds"
  * **Date**. Entry date.
  * **Amount Num**. Value of the transaction.  Ledger Explorer assumes all values are the same currency.
